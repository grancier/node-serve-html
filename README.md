### Usage
1. Clone this repo
2. cd into cloned directory
3. run `node server.js`

Then navigate to `localhost:3000` in a browser.
Now you should see the contents of `index.html`
including the `styles.css` and `main.js` files rendered.

An ExpressJS example is also included in the file `express.js`
run it with `node express.js`

To test the client-side js has loaded, click the `red` or `green`
buttons. You should see the text color change.
